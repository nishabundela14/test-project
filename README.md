### Deployment

### Notes
- Running the app you can go and see live url directly.
- Code deployed to github repo will share the link.
- It took me some time to open fig file as i dont had any relevant software to open and also i didn't work on that but I figured it out finally.
- Also i have not deployed to Github pages or any other medium before so choose to deploy this on heroku and also added code to github.
- I feel the sass i could have written more genric if i had more time.
- Also i could have added other features to improve like    pagination, filter option by different fields and sorting.
- Also new data should be listed first which will be good option and can have folder view where we could have seen archive , trash kind of data.
- Due to time i was not able to implement date and time functionality properly on last communication field
- I have used api calls for search and archive functionality as was thinking in case of large data front end search and filter is not good option.
- I didn't use Typescript as my setup giving some error and taking to long to resolve.
